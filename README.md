## Motivation for Project Choice
We decided to focus our project on food insecurity in Georgia because it is a pressing issue in the state. Majority of the team is based in Georgia and after various discusses we decided to look at a real issue affecting the population in that state. The data we found contained a plethora of information regarding obesity, poverty, government assistance, and the prevalance of the issue in adults and children. 

## Questions 
1. Which counties in Georgia are the most food insecure?
2. Is there a relationship between the counties with food insecurity and high levels of obesity?
3. Do people in food insecure areas tend to be on public assistance?
4. [Insert Jinnyâ€™s Question]

## Data Background 
The data looked at various details all 159 counties in Georgia. We focused on the data points that would address the questions we asked. The data focused on the number of people who experienced F.I., the percent of household per county who fell below the low threshold, the adult obesity rate, the number of households on government assistance and experiencing poverty, and the percentage of adults and chidren experiencing food insecurity.
